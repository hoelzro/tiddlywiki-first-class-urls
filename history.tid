! 1.0.1

!! Bug Fixes

  * Handle dragging URLs into a wiki
  * Don't error out when installing plugins or importing tiddlers
  * Set a `User-Agent` header when fetching page metadata (some sites take the lack of `User-Agent` as a signal for shenanigans)

!! Features

  * Allow adding extra fields to tiddlers imported by `PUT /plugins/hoelzro/first-class-urls/import` via a JSON-encoded object in the request body

! 1.0.0

  * Allow users to import tiddlers by pasting them into their wiki, or by submitting them to a route
  * Fetch metadata for URLs based on "extractors" - only current implementations are GitHub and a fallback one
